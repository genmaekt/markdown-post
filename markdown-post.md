# Sunday Blues
_It always seems that Sundays come and go too quickly._ 
---
A constant fight between resting or being productive encompass my Sundays. Today, I tried to do a little of both. After a lazy morning in bed watching numerous episodes of NCIS it was time to get on with the day. I had a laundry list of things to accomplish:
+ Do laundry
+ Get groceries
+ Fill up car with gas
+ Clean the kitchen, living room, and bedroom
+ Work on Epicodus lessons
+ Meal prep

One-by-one I checked off the items on my list, and here I am, working on my Epicodus lessons. This one is learning Markdown.
